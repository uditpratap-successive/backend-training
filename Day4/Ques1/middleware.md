Middleware in Node.js
Middleware functions are essential components in the Node.js ecosystem, enabling developers to intercept and manipulate requests and responses within the application's request-response cycle. They provide a flexible mechanism for executing code before or after the main logic of a request handler.

What is Middleware?
In Node.js, middleware refers to functions that have access to the request (req) and response (res) objects. These functions can perform tasks such as authentication, data validation, logging, error handling, and more. Middleware functions can be used individually or chained together to create a pipeline of processing steps for incoming requests.

Usage
Middleware in Express.js
Express.js, a popular web framework for Node.js, simplifies the usage of middleware through its use() method. Middleware functions can be applied globally to all routes or selectively to specific routes.

Global Middleware:Global middleware is applied to all incoming requests. This is useful for tasks that need to be performed for every request, such as logging.
Route-specific Middleware:Middleware can also be applied to specific routes, allowing developers to define custom behavior for particular endpoints.
Error Handling Middleware:Express.js provides built-in support for error handling middleware. These middleware functions are invoked when an error occurs during request processing, allowing developers to centralize error handling logic.
Conclusion
Middleware plays a vital role in Node.js development by enabling developers to modularize and reuse code, implement cross-cutting concerns, and maintain separation of concerns. By understanding how middleware works and how to use it effectively, developers can create more maintainable and scalable Node.js applications.

This documentation provides a conceptual overview of middleware in Node.js, focusing on its usage within Express.js, one of the most widely used web frameworks for Node.js.
