Client-Server Architecture
The client-server architecture is a distributed computing model that divides the functionality of a software application into two separate entities: the client and the server. These entities communicate with each other over a network to fulfill the requirements of the application. The client-server architecture is one of the most common and widely used architectural patterns in modern computing.

Overview
Client:
The client is the front-end or user-facing part of the application that interacts directly with the user.
It requests services or resources from the server and displays the results to the user.
Clients can be various devices such as web browsers, mobile devices, desktop applications, or IoT devices.
Server:
The server is the back-end or service provider part of the application that processes requests from clients.
It hosts and manages resources, performs business logic, and provides services to clients.
Servers can be physical machines, virtual machines, or cloud-based services.
Key Characteristics
Client-Server Communication:
Clients and servers communicate with each other over a network using protocols such as HTTP, TCP/IP, or WebSocket.
Clients send requests to servers, and servers respond with the requested data or perform the requested actions.
Centralized Control:
Servers typically have centralized control over resources, data, and business logic.
Clients rely on servers to provide access to resources and perform necessary operations.
Separation of Concerns:
Client-server architecture promotes the separation of concerns between the presentation (client) and business logic/data management (server) layers.
This separation allows for modularity, maintainability, and scalability of the application.
Scalability:
Client-server architecture supports horizontal and vertical scalability.
Servers can be scaled to handle increased load by adding more resources or distributing workload across multiple servers.
Advantages
Flexibility: Clients and servers can be developed independently and can run on different platforms, allowing for flexibility in technology choices.
Scalability: The architecture allows for easy scaling of resources to handle growing user demands.
Centralized Management: Centralized control over data and business logic simplifies maintenance and updates.
Security: Servers can enforce security policies and access controls to protect sensitive data.
Disadvantages
Single Point of Failure: If the server goes down, clients may lose access to resources or services.
Network Dependency: Client-server applications rely on network connectivity, making them vulnerable to network failures or latency issues.
Complexity: Managing communication protocols, data synchronization, and security measures can add complexity to the architecture.
Use Cases
Web Applications: Client-server architecture is commonly used in web development, where the browser acts as the client and communicates with a web server to access resources.
Enterprise Systems: Many enterprise applications follow a client-server architecture, where desktop or mobile clients interact with backend servers to access corporate data and services.
Cloud Computing: Cloud-based services often utilize client-server architecture to provide scalable and reliable infrastructure and platform services.
